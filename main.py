            - Algorithms & Data Structures Group Project - 
        This is a virtual version of the famous game of Jenga
        
    Total data structures used:
        1. Linked List
        2. Stacks
        3. Matrices
    
    
    Total algorithms used:
        1. Algo to generate the probability each cell has of falling, according to its position on the tower
        2. Algo to check if the tower will fall after each move + update values of the probability
        3. Algo to add new elements to the top
        
    Features of our game:
        - Backtracking: you will be able to go back after each move if you don't feel you removed the right piece
        - Probabilistic piece removal: to account for skill in real life, we will be using a probabilistic model to
                                       simulate what pieces would be harder to take out in a real game of jenga
        - Matrix Indexing: after each move, we need to access the top-most index to add the new piece
        
    Explanation: In a Jenga game pieces are placed next to each other in blocks of three and on top of each other
                 at 90Â° angle forming a grid. In order to simulate this, we will have an empty 3D matrix with the
                 maximum theoretical height of a Jenga tower so that we can populate it after with ease. The 1st, 
                 2nd, and 3rd dimensions will represent the height of our jenga game, each piece in our game, and 
                 each component of every one piece, respectively. Since the pieces are placed on top of others at 
                 right angles, taking out a singular piece will affect the weight distributed of at least 3 other
                 pieces below. To account for this, each piece will be divided into 3 components: left, middle, and 
                 right, that we will use to distribute our weight.
